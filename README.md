Database Driven Full Stack React & Express App

This is a simple movie review app. I have a database of users and a database of movies which are displayed in a list with a poster. The user can navigate onto the movie page and leave a comment, where it will be added to the database and show on the app.

Users can like other comments and delete comments. If a user wishes to see only films of a certain genre, they can filter these.
